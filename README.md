# vue-js-github-api
Vue.js &amp; Axios for fetching external data

A simple app that will show search results for partial string matches, and will allow users to filter by programming language, fetching 
data from the Github Search API.

## Project Structure
Just 2 files:
```
./index.html
./vueApp.js
```
`vueApp.js` will contain all the logic for this app, and the `index.html` file will contain this app’s main view.
